Hindi (`apertium-hin`)
===============================================================================

This is an Apertium monolingual language package for Hindi. What
you can use this language package for:

* Morphological analysis of Hindi
* Morphological generation of Hindii
* Part-of-speech tagging of Hindi

Requirements
===============================================================================

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.3.0)
* apertium (>= 3.3.0)
* vislcg3 (>= 0.9.9.10297)

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: apertium.org

Compiling
===============================================================================

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

```
$ ./configure
$ make
```

You can use `./autogen.sh` instead of `./configure` if you're compiling
from GitHub.

If you're doing development, you don't have to install the data, you
can use it directly from this directory.

If you are installing this language package as a prerequisite for an
Apertium translation pair, then do (typically as root / with sudo):

```
# make install
```

You can give a `--prefix` to `./configure` to install as a non-root user,
but make sure to use the same prefix when installing the translation
pair and any other language packages.

Testing
===============================================================================

If you are in the source directory after running make, the following
commands should work:

echo “This is a test sentence” | aperium hin-tagger
echo “This is a test sentence” | aperium hin-morph

If this does not work, try running

echo “This is a test sentence” | aperium -d path/to/apertium-hin hin-tagger
